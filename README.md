# how we done 
1.first we make slides using column 
then we strch them and make clicable when they click they perform onclick operation
and play selected file using audio player ,this is same logic for all 7 slides.
2. before that make sure that you finished all dependancies. 
3. for audio player we downloaded new pakage and add in the pubspec.yaml file 
without that our sound systom won't work.
